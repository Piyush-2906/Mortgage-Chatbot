# Mortgage Chatbot using NLP

• In this project I provide design of domain specific chatbot by using rule-matcher algorithm along with NLP techniques.

• This project is domain specific project in which I have a 100’s of domain specific documents and in past the business user manually searches into the documents to get the answer of their questions.

• This chatbot reduces the time and efforts of business user as it gives the answer of there any question just in a second.

• Rule-Matcher algorithm provides us the result on basic level that means it works on initial level as it gives the heading of any topic or parent fact of any questions once the algorithm reaches to correct parent fact.

• NLP techniques start their work and find the most similar text by using word embedding techniques as TF-IDF and cosine similarity under that parent fact and come up with the correct child fact(answer).

• This chatbot also handled the domain specific synonyms of words while typing the questions by using word embedding techniques.
